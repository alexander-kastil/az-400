# Getting Started

To avoid problems with saved credentials I recommend using an alternate browser or log of all accounts in your browser before starting the lab.

- [Get the Azure Pass from the GoDeploy Lab](../09-godeploy-lab)
- [Activate your Azure Pass to create your Azure Subscription](../05-azure-pass) to create a subscription with free grants

    >Note: Azure Passes can only be used once per e-mail account. Please do not use Azure AD Accounts (Cooperate Accounts). Use the same e-mail account that you will use for the Azure DevOps Organization. If you are not sure, please register a new Account:

    - [Outlook.com](http://www.outlook.com/)      

- [Register an Azure DevOps Organization](../07-azure-devops)
  
  >Note: You can also work on your own machine. Execute [setup-az-400.ps1](../../setup/setup-az-400.ps1) to install the required Software on a Windows machine

- Configure Git on the Lab VM
- Setup Git and Fork the class repo

## Setup Git and clone the class repo

- [Register a Github User Account](https://github.com/) or use your existing account

- Clone Class Repo:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Student01/az-400](https://github.com/alexander-kastil/az-400)
```
