## Demos 

- Create an [Azure Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/how-to-create-configure-dev-center) and register the `Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure` provider at subscription level.

- The pool shows up in the Azure DevOps portal under `Project Settings` -> `Agent Pools` und pipelines can be configured to use the pool.

    trigger: none
    pr: none

    variables:
    buildConfiguration: Release
    appPath: src/services/catalog-service/api/

    pool: az-pool

    stages:
