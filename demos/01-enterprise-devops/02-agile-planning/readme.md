### Connect Azure Boards and GitHub Issues

There are two options to connect Azure Boards and GitHub Issues:

#### Setup Connection using GitHub App

- In Azure DevOps, navigate to the project settings and add a new GitHub connection to your GitHub repo.

or

- Install the [Azure Boards](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards) App from the marketplace

- In GitHub, navigate to the https://github.com/settings/profile, configure Azure Boards and check the installation using the configure button. 

- Select the organization and the project.

#### Setup Connection using  PAT Tokens

Create two PAT tokens. One for Azure DevOps and on for GitHub and store them as secrets:

- `ADO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - Azure DevOps | User settings | Security | Personal access tokens
  - repo permissions

- `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - GitHub | Personal settings | Developer settings | Personal access tokens
  - read / write

[GitHub Issues to Azure DevOps](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-issues-to-azure-devops).

[Sync Pull Requests to Azure Boards](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sync-pull-requests-to-azure-boards)

- Generate a PAT token for the ADO and persist it to the repo settings as secret.

      steps:
        - name: GitHub Issues to Azure DevOps
          uses: danhellem/github-actions-issue-to-work-item@v2.0
          env:
            ado_token: "${{ secrets.ADO_SYNC_TOKEN }}"
            github_token: "${{ secrets.GH_SYNC_TOKEN }}"
            ado_organization: "integrations-training"
            ado_project: "az-400-next"
            ado_wit: "Issue"
