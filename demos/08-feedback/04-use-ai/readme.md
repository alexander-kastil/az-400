# Use AI for DevOps

## Write Docs using reusable prompts

Use a re-usable prompt `create-docs.prompt.md` to write documentation for your project:

## Write Unit Tests

AI can help you write unit tests for your code.

## Use MCPs to complete tasks

- Explain registration of MCP Servers using mcp.json

[Model Control Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

[MCP Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/servers) are used to provide a context for AI models to work with. They can be registered in the `mcp.json` file in the root of your project.
