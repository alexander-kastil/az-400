# App Deployment

- Show [catalog-ci-cd.yml](/.azdo/catalog-ci-cd.yml) pipeline that deploys the catalog service to Azure App Service.

- Show [spfx-ci-cd.yml](/.azdo/spfx-ci-cd.yml) pipeline that deploys the SPFx app to SharePoint Online App Catalog.

> Note: The SPFx deployment is an outdated pattern and has been updated in SPFx 1.21 and does not use Gulp tasks anymore. Still it demonstrates how to deploy an older app.
