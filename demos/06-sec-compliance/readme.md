| Threat Modeling               | Systematically identify vulnerabilities and attack vectors using STRIDE methodology during the design phase, when fixes are most cost-effective      |
| Software Composition Analysis | Scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities, license compliance risks, and supply chain visibility using Mend Bolt in Azure DevOps pipelines      |
| Static Code Analysis          | Automatically detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues using SonarCloud in CI/CD workflows with pull request feedback          |
| Azure Policy                  | Enforce organizational standards and compliance by validating Azure resource properties, locations, and configurations at scale across subscriptions |
